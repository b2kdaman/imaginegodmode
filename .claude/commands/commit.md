Create a commit with all current changes and push to the remote repository. Follow these steps:

1. Review the current git status and diff to understand what changed
2. Build the project first (run `npm run build`)
3. Stage all changes including the built files
4. Create an appropriate commit message following the repository's style
5. Commit the changes
6. Push to the remote repository
