Create a commit with all current changes and push to the remote repository. Follow these steps:

1. Review the current git status and diff to understand what changed
2. Update README.md documentation to reflect the changes:
   - Update Features section if new features were added
   - Update Components/Hooks sections if new components or hooks were created
   - Update Usage section if UI or workflows changed
   - Update Notes section for any architectural or styling changes
3. Build the project first (run `npm run build`)
4. Stage all changes including the built files and updated docs
5. Create an appropriate commit message following the repository's style
6. Commit the changes
7. Push to the remote repository
